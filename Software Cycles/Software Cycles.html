        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Software development life cycles (SDLC) help guide teams through the process of building and maintaining
            software. There are several popular models, each with its own approach, benefits, and challenges. Below are
            five common models: Cascade (Waterfall), Iterative, Incremental, Spiral, and Prototype. We will compare them
            based on structure, flexibility, and risk management.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="model">
            <h3>Cascade Model (Waterfall)</h3>
            <p>The Cascade model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next
                one begins. It follows these phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and
                Maintenance.</p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple to manage, clear milestones.</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Rigid, difficult to adapt to changes, high risk if issues are found late.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model">
            <h3>Iterative Model</h3>
            <p>The Iterative model repeats cycles of development in iterations, improving and refining the product at
                each step. Feedback is incorporated at the end of each iteration.</p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Flexibility, easy to adjust requirements during development.</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can be resource-intensive, especially if many iterations are needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model">
            <h3>Incremental Development Model</h3>
            <p>This model breaks down the software into smaller, manageable sections (increments), where each part is
                developed and deployed incrementally. Each new increment builds upon the previous ones.</p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Reduces risk, earlier delivery of partial product.</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Complexity can increase over time if not managed well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model">
            <h3>Spiral Model</h3>
            <p>The Spiral model combines iterative development with risk analysis. It consists of multiple phases, where
                each phase begins with risk assessment and planning, followed by design, implementation, and evaluation.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong focus on risk management, adaptable to changes.</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can be complex and costly due to the extensive planning and analysis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="model">
            <h3>Prototype Model</h3>
            <p>The Prototype model emphasizes building a prototype to understand user requirements before actual
                development begins. The prototype is then used as a foundation for the final product.</p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Helps clarify user needs early on, reduces misunderstandings.</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can lead to scope creep if not properly managed.</p>
        </div>
